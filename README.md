# ScriptsPowershell

Here are various PowerShell scripts that I created based on my needs:

- ConfigSwitchProcurve:
      This script is designed to modify a list of ProCurve switches parameters to enhance their security.

- CreateFolderForEachADuser:
      This script creates a folder for each user in Active Directory (AD) and grants them full permissions within the folder.

- ModifyGroupInAD:
      This script modifies group membership in accordance with a CSV file containing users and their respective groups.

- ModifyIpOpenVPN:
      This script modifies the OpenVPN GUI configuration to change the public IP of the server.

- PaperCutLinkToAD:
      This script facilitates the linking of PaperCut with Windows AD/KOXO.
      It assigns the PaperCut login code to the FaxNumber attribute of the user.
      Additionally, it allows integration with KOXO, intending to use KOXO labels for both username/password and printer code.
